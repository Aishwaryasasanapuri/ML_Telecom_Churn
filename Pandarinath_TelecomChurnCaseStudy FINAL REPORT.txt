FINAL REPORT
============
Approach:
1. Data is cleaned as made it for performing analysis
2. Created Churn variable derived from given data
3. Performed EDA Univariant and Bivariant
4. Performed PCA, LASSO, RFE on cleaned data
5. Performed SMOTE to address imbalance in cleaned data
6. Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree

Parameters considered for selecting a model:
1. Accuracy of the model
2. Confusion matrix details on churn
3. Number of features

Analysis:
1. LASSO with Random Forest is best suited model with 43 features, accuracy of 94% and less false-postives.
2. Dominant Features identified are:
	arpu_6  
	arpu_7  
	arpu_8  
	onnet_mou_6 
	onnet_mou_7 
	onnet_mou_8 
	offnet_mou_6
	offnet_mou_7
	offnet_mou_8
	roam_ic_mou_6
3. Other models is in the range of 82% to 86% with features 47 to 72 with a moderate false-positives.
4. Same dominant features are observed to be in other models too.
